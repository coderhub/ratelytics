# ratelytics
Ratelytics provide a captain with suggestions to change the course slightly to reduce fuel consumption by a few percent.

## Inspiration
We want to help the maritime industry reduce cost through optimizing fuel usage.

## What it does
We built a statistical model which takes in historical and real time data to determine optimal fuel usage.

## How we built it
We analyzed data from the Noon Report and Lloyd's List. Open data APIs were used to gather data on location, weather, wind, and currents. Combining and analyzing these data points allowed us to gain insights into the factors that contribute to fuel inefficiencies.

## Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into were problem framing and data comprehension.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the model we developed. The model we developed had very high accuracy scores and illuminated some surprising factors that affect fuel usage.

## What we learned
While talking with mentors we learned congestion at ports can be very expensive.

## What's next for Ratelytics (validation, research, coding, design)?
We hope to continue building out this project and find industry partners.
